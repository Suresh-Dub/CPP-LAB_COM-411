<h1 align="center">CPP(C++)</h1>
C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was first developed in the 1980s as an extension of the C programming language. It is an object-oriented programming language that allows developers to create complex applications using classes, objects, and inheritance.

C++ is a compiled language, which means that the code is translated into machine-readable instructions by a compiler before it can be executed. It is a powerful language that is used in a variety of applications, including operating systems, database management systems, and video games.

One of the key features of C++ is its support for templates, which are used to create generic functions and classes that can be used with different data types. This feature makes C++ a popular choice for developing libraries and frameworks.

C++ also includes features such as operator overloading, multiple inheritance, and virtual functions, which allow developers to create more flexible and efficient code. However, these advanced features can make the language more difficult to learn and use than some other programming languages.

Overall, C++ is a powerful programming language that is widely used in industry and academia for developing complex software applications.
